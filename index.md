# Ophelia

*Ophel'IA* ("Hamlet's beloved beautiful woman") she's known because of her madness and immortal love for Hamlet, but the full Shakespeare's mastery piece does not favor to her magnificent character.
Ophelia is the epitome of goodness, the brightness and the elegance of simplicity.

*I will not go so far as to affirm that to construct a history of human thought without a deep study of mathematical ideas in successive ages is like omitting Hamlet from the drama that bears his name.
That would be pretending too much. But it certainly amounts to excluding the character of Ophelia. This simile is particularly accurate. Ophelia is essential in the drama, she is very charming, and a little crazy.
Let us then admit that the study of mathematics is a divine folly of the human spirit, a refuge from the atrocious urgency of contingent events.*

*- Alfred North Whitehead -*

# Motivation

As Data Scientist or Data Analyst don't want to waist too much time guessing how damn we may use PySpark's API in a correct and optimized way, sometimes we just want a prompt answer instead of a full nicely code. With the intent of that, this project
aims to help to reduce the complexity of the analytical lifecycle for every DA or DS who uses PySpark frequently.

Now is the turn of a new smart and very extravaganza Ophelia serving to optimize the learning curve with PySpark's must common functionality features such as:
- Build PySpark *ML & Mllib* pipelines in a simplified replicable and secure way
- Embedded optimized techniques helping users struggling with *data skewness problems*
- Easy to use and build your own models and data mining pipelines with PySpark using *Ophelia spark wrappers*
- Security and simplified usage for exploring new *PySpark features* for data mining replicating the most commonly used functionality in libraries such as Pandas and Numpy
- Simple *Pythonic* syntax: *'Not too fancy things to do the hard work'*
- Utility for *RDD level pre-processing* data in a simple manner
- Time series treatment and portfolio optimization with different techniques based on Portfolio Theory such as Risk Parity, Efficient Frontier, Clustering by Sortion's ratio and Sharpe's ratio, among others

It is time for Ophelia's vendetta and claim for her brightness...

# Getting Started

## Requirements
Before starting, you'll need to have installed pyspark >= 3.0.x, pandas >= 1.1.3, numpy >= 1.19.1, dask >= 2.30.x, scikit-learn >= 0.23.x 
Additionally, if you want to use the Ophelia API, you'll also need Python (supported 3.7 and 3.8 versions) and pip installed.

## Building from source
Just clone the ophelia repo and import Ophelia:
   
    git clone https://github.com/LuisFalva/ophelia.git

To import we do:
    
    from ophelia.ophelib.OpheliaMain import Ophelia

</p>
    
For initialize Ophelia with Spark embedded session we use:

    ophelia = Ophelia("Set Your Spark App Name")
    spark = ophelia.SparkSession
