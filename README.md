These features empower users with the tools they need to handle complex ML tasks effectively, ensuring a seamless experience from data processing to model deployment. users with the tools they need to handle complex machine learning tasks effectively, ensuring a seamless experience from data processing to model deployment.

# Getting Started:

### 📜 Requirements

Before starting, you'll need to have installed: 
- pyspark >= 3.0.x
- pandas >= 1.1.3
- numpy >= 1.19.1
- dask >= 2.30.x
- scikit-learn >= 0.23.x

Additionally, if you want to use the Ophelia package, you'll also need Python (supported 3.7 and 3.8 versions) and pip installed.

### 🛠 Building from the source️

Just clone the `Ophelian` repo and import `Ophelian`:
```sh
# github repository name will change soon into 'ophelian'
git clone https://github.com/LuisFalva/ophelia.git
```

After wiring and clone the `Ophelian` repo go to:
```sh
# parent root package name will change soon into 'ophelian'
cd ophelian_spark
```
### 📡 First time installation
> For the very first time running and installing Ophelian in your local machine you need to wire with Ophelian's main repo.
Just run the following script in order to set up correctly:

And execute the following `make` instruction:
```sh   
make install
```

**First Important Note**: You must see a successful message like the one below.
```sh   
[Ophelian] Successfully installed ophelian_spark:0.1.3. Have fun! =)
```

**Second Important Note**: You also can pull Ophelia 0.1.0
[or make sure version matches with the one you need and configure the env `OPHELIAN_DOCKER_VERSION`]
docker image and use it as base image for new images.
```sh   
make docker-pull
```

Also, you can push new changes to your corresponding version as follows:
```sh   
make docker-build
```

### 📦 Importing and initializing Ophelian

To initialize `Ophelian` with Spark embedded session use:

```python
from ophelian.ophelian_spark import Ophelian
ophelian = Ophelian("Spark App Name")
sc = ophelian.Spark.build_spark_context()
  ____          _            _  _

```
Main class objects provided by initializing Ophelia session:

- `read` & `write`

```python
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.read.spark_read import Read
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.write.spark_write import Write
```
- `generic` & `functions`

```python
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.functions import (
  Shape, Rolling, Reshape, CorrMat, CrossTabular, 
  PctChange, Selects, DynamicSampling
)
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.generic import (
  split_date, row_index, lag_min_max_data, regex_expr, remove_duplicate_element,
  year_array, dates_index, sorted_date_list, feature_pick, binary_search,
  century_from_year, simple_average, delta_series, simple_moving_average, average,
  weight_moving_average, single_exp_smooth, double_exp_smooth, initial_seasonal_components,
  triple_exp_smooth, row_indexing, string_match
)
```
- ML package for `unsupervised`, `sampling` and `feature_miner` objects

```python
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.ml.sampling.synthetic_sample import SyntheticSample
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.ml.unsupervised.feature import PCAnalysis, SingularVD
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.ml.feature_miner import (
  BuildStringIndex, BuildOneHotEncoder, 
  BuildVectorAssembler, BuildStandardScaler,
  SparkToNumpy, NumpyToVector
)
```

Let me show you some application examples:

The `Read` class implements Spark reading object in multiple formats `{'csv', 'parquet', 'excel', 'json'}`

```python
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.read.spark_read import Read

spark_df = spark.readFile(path, 'csv', header=True, infer_schema=True)
```

Also, you may import class `Shape` from factory `functions` in order to see the dimension of our spark DataFrame such as numpy style.

```python
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.functions import Shape

dic = {
    'Product': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],
    'Year': [2010, 2010, 2010, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2012, 2012, 2012],
    'Revenue': [100, 200, 300, 110, 190, 320, 120, 220, 350]
}
dic_to_df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(data=dic))
dic_to_df.show(10, False)

+---------+------------+-----------+
| Product |    Year    |  Revenue  |
+---------+------------+-----------+
|    A    |    2010    |    100    |
|    B    |    2010    |    200    |
|    C    |    2010    |    300    |
|    A    |    2011    |    110    |
|    B    |    2011    |    190    |
|    C    |    2011    |    320    |
|    A    |    2012    |    120    |
|    B    |    2012    |    220    |
|    C    |    2012    |    350    |
+---------+------------+-----------+

dic_to_df.Shape
(9, 3)
```

The `pct_change` wrapper is added to the Spark `DataFrame` class in order to have the most commonly used method in Pandas
objects to get the relative percentage change from one observation to another, sorted by a date-type column and lagged by a numeric-type column.

```python
from ophelian.ophelian_spark.functions import PctChange

dic_to_df.pctChange().show(10, False)

+---------------------+
|       Revenue       |
+---------------------+
| null                |
| 1.0                 |
| 0.5                 |
| -0.6333333333333333 |
| 0.7272727272727273  |
| 0.6842105263157894  |
| -0.625              |
| 0.8333333333333333  |
| 0.5909090909090908  |
+---------------------+
```

Another option is to configure all receiving parameters from the function, as follows:
- `periods`; this parameter will control the offset of the lag periods. Since the default value is 1, this will always return a lag-1 information DataFrame.
- `partition_by`; this parameter will fix the partition column over the DataFrame, e.g. 'bank_segment', 'assurance_product_type'.
- `order_by`; order by parameter will be the specific column to order the sequential observations, e.g. 'balance_date', 'trade_close_date', 'contract_date'.
- `pct_cols`; percentage change col (pct_cols) will be the specific column to lag-over giving back the relative change between one element to other, e.g. 𝑥𝑡 ÷ 𝑥𝑡 − 1

In this case, we will specify only the `periods` parameter to yield a lag of -2 days over the DataFrame.
```python
dic_to_df.pctChange(periods=2).na.fill(0).show(5, False)

+--------------------+
|Revenue             |
+--------------------+
|0.0                 |
|0.0                 |
|2.0                 |
|-0.44999999999999996|
|-0.3666666666666667 |
+--------------------+
only showing top 5 rows
```

Adding parameters: `partition_by`, `order_by` & `pct_cols`
```python
dic_to_df.pctChange(partition_by="Product", order_by="Year", pct_cols="Revenue").na.fill(0).show(5, False)

+---------------------+
|Revenue              |
+---------------------+
|0.0                  |
|-0.050000000000000044|
|0.1578947368421053   |
|0.0                  |
|0.06666666666666665  |
+---------------------+
only showing top 5 rows
```

You may also lag more than one column at a time by simply adding a list with string column names:
```python
dic_to_df.pctChange(partition_by="Product", order_by="Year", pct_cols=["Year", "Revenue"]).na.fill(0).show(5, False)

+--------------------+---------------------+
|Year                |Revenue              |
+--------------------+---------------------+
|0.0                 |0.0                  |
|4.975124378110429E-4|-0.050000000000000044|
|4.972650422674363E-4|0.1578947368421053   |
|0.0                 |0.0                  |
|4.975124378110429E-4|0.06666666666666665  |
+--------------------+---------------------+
only showing top 5 rows
```
